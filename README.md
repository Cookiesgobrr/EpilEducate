# EpilEducate
EpilEducate is my first Swift app, submitted for the 2026 Swift Student Challenge. It is an educational playground designed to teach users about epilepsy and what to do if they witness one happening in front of them. EpilEducate also educates about EEGs, and how brain activity is measured.


## Key Features
- 🧠 Neural Monitoring (EEG): A real-time BrainWaveView built with SwiftUI Canvas that visualizes the "spike-and-wave" patterns of a seizure.
- ⚡️ Interactive Triggers: A page that demonstrates how factors like stress and sleep deprivation push the brain toward the seizure threshold.
- 📳 Multisensory Haptics: Integrated UIImpactFeedbackGenerator that allows users to physically "feel" neural spikes, improving accessibility for low-vision users.
